Churn_Prediction - ML project.
My first Machine Learning Classification Project. 
Customer Churn is usualy used to quantify the number of customers who have either unsubscribed or canceled their service contract.
The telecom customer dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
The purpose of my work is to try to identify at least 70% of telecom customers with the intention of leaving the company in the near future.
In order to achieve that i have used and compared between 3 predictive Machine Leaning classification models, in python:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Neighbors
- Decision Trees
